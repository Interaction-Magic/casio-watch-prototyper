This is an interaction design tool for the Casio F91-W watch.

It can be used in connection with the [Sensor Watch](https://www.crowdsupply.com/oddly-specific-objects/sensor-watch) project by [Joey Castillo](https://twitter.com/josecastillo) to update the watch display in realtime.

## Feature highlights

+ Multi-step, muli-sequence animation builder for all watch segments and LEDs
+ Create sequence logic using 3x buttons as trigger keys
+ Bluetooth connection to hardware for realtime rendering to actual watch
+ Import / export of sequence data to share designs
+ Continuous auto-save in case of accidental page reload
+ Full undo/redo history

### Useful shortcuts

+ Quickly fill in multiple segments by dragging mouse when held down.
+ Start dragging _on_ a segment to apply that fill to all others. Start dragging _off_ a segment to toggle fill state.
+ Simulate button presses with mouse or keyboard shortcuts: `q` = light, `a` = mode, `s` = alarm
+ When editing a step duration, use arrow keys `UP` and `DOWN` for quick scrolling, and press `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `Enter` to apply to all steps in that sequence
+ Enable/disable segment coupling in settings for added realism

### Feature roadmap

+ Drag-drop re-ordering of steps
+ Help page
+ Add missing pixel (leading dot to digit 0)
+ Add buzzer write to watch
